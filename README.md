# bus_tracker: Tracking the Madison Bike Week bus
This is a Shiny app that tracks Madison Metro bus number 148.

# Functionality
Creates a `leaflet` map that shows the bus position, with a button to manually refresh the position

# Issues and future improvements
- issue: currently shows empty world map when bus is not in service; should provide explicit message instead
- improvement: create popup that provides additional information about current trip (e.g. route)
